        What I'm Looking Forward To

        I'm excited about visually seeing my growth as an engineer through my
        code. Looking back at older code, I'm able to literally see the
        progression I have made as I learned new concepts, tech languages, and
        experienced new things in my journey. There are so many works I would be
        most looking forward to in this role because I love learning new
        concepts, experimenting with new tech languages and their syntaxes, and
        building projects. But if I have to choose just one, it would be to
        create a JS library for running Tailwind CSS v4.0 in the browser. I'm
        looking forward to this the most because I have never built a library
        before, and it seems like it would be a lot of fun. Also, I would be
        super excited to see how much I improve as an Engineer from
        experimenting with building a library and making mistakes along the way,
        to becoming familiar with what not to do and how to build it correctly.
        Furthermore, as someone who has built many applications in the browser,
        I would love to see what additional aspects of the browser I will learn
        that I can accomplish with code.
