He quickly stood out for his technical skills in MongoDB, Express, React, and TypeScript, and the ability to apply them to real-world projects. Richard excelled at both individual work and teamwork, always contributing valuable ideas and collaborating effectively. He demonstrated impressive problem-solving skills, tackling challenges with a positive, growth-oriented mindset. By the end of the cohort, Richard successfully delivered a high-quality project, a smart restaurant kitchen management system where users can track orders from the POS to the kitchen. Iâ€™m confident that he will continue to thrive in software development and I highly recommend him for any future opportunities.",

            text: "It is with great pleasure and without reservation that I recommend Richard Choi for their search for professional opportunities as a software developer. As a volunteer team leader during the Commit Your Code 2025 tech cohort event (CYC), I had the distinct honor of working closely with Richard and observing their remarkable talents, unwavering commitment, and significant growth. The CYC cohort was a demanding program, challenging over 120 participants across 14 teams to build fully functional applications within a six-week timeframe. In this dynamic and challenging environment, Richard consistently distinguished himself through his exceptional abilities in front-end development, documentation, and leadership. His proficiency in these areas was instrumental in enabling our team to meet every minimum viable product (MVP) requirement, deliver all work on time, and maintain a high level of team motivation. Richard's contributions to our team were pivotal to our success. Specifically, he played a key role in creating the initial coding practices document, guiding team members to adhere to these practices through thorough code reviews, and delivering several critical MVP components, including an order prediction tool for a smart kitchen application. To illustrate, Richard single-handedly developed a predictive/historical order patterns tool for our application, which proved to be one of the most complex and crucial tools required for the program's final presentation. Furthermore, Richard demonstrated initiative by consistently keeping the team informed of upcoming deadlines, and ensuring all documentation and pending code reviews were addressed promptly. This proactive approach not only enhanced our team's output but also fostered a highly collaborative and productive environment. For example, within just two weeks, the team successfully resolved over 50 code pull requests; Richard not only reviewed these submissions but also provided valuable feedback that improved the code quality and prevented future issues, enabling the team to complete more than 60% of the project deliverables in a very short span of time. Beyond their technical expertise, Richard possesses outstanding autonomy, team-building skills, and leadership qualities. Richard consistently demonstrated a strong work ethic, an eagerness to learn, and a positive, solution-oriented attitude. Their ability to effectively manage time to meet tight deadlines and to take a leadership role in guiding team discussions on complex problems was particularly impressive and significantly contributed to the team's cohesion and productivity. For example, recognizing the cohort program's limited timeline and our team's smaller size, Richard proactively fostered a positive and supportive environment. He consistently celebrated small victories, provided constructive and highly productive feedback on team members' work, and served as a valuable resource for navigating the technology stack. Richard's deep knowledge and willingness to assist empowered teammates to make informed decisions independently and to develop actionable plans that consistently met every deadline. I was consistently impressed by Richard's resilience in the face of challenges, creative problem-solving skills, and genuine desire to support others. This combination of qualities, coupled with their technical abilities, makes them an exceptional candidate. In summary, Richard is a highly skilled, motivated, and dedicated individual with a strong work ethic and a passion for technology. Their contributions to the Commit Your Code 2025 cohort were invaluable, and I am confident that they will excel in any future endeavor. I wholeheartedly and unreservedly recommend Richard Choi. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information or have any questions. I would be pleased to provide additional details regarding Richard's performance and potential.",
