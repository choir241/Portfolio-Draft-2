He quickly stood out for his technical skills in MongoDB, Express, React, and TypeScript, and the ability to apply them to real-world projects. Richard excelled at both individual work and teamwork, always contributing valuable ideas and collaborating effectively. He demonstrated impressive problem-solving skills, tackling challenges with a positive, growth-oriented mindset. By the end of the cohort, Richard successfully delivered a high-quality project, a smart restaurant kitchen management system where users can track orders from the POS to the kitchen. Iâ€™m confident that he will continue to thrive in software development and I highly recommend him for any future opportunities.",
