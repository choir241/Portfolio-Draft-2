<img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="" />
<p class = 'font'>Since the beginning, I have been interested in technology, especially being fascinated by making my own video game.  While exploring my love for drawing, I grew to love creating and growing my skills: which developed my passion for experimenting with code, creating new projects with code, and learning new concepts about coding and technology. </p>
<p class = 'font'> Coming from a banking background, I also developed a love for assisting people, which I hope I can achieve through making various applications.  I wish to continue working in an environment that will promote growth and experimentation while also being a place where I can help others by constantly building applications.</p>
